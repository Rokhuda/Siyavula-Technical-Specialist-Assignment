Assignment 2.1
- A quadratic equation has three constants. i.e. a,b, and c. 
-  Import the random library which provides access to the function which enables the generation of random numbers
-  Generate a random number for the constant "a". The result has to be between -10 and 10 and ensure that a is not zero. The random number can range from negative infinity to positive infinity but for simplicity, the range has been limited to between -10 and 10. Once the random number is generated, the string to be returned is the constant "a" and the unknown variable x squared

- Generate a random number for the constant "b" between the range -10 and 10. A range has been defined for simplicity, but can range between negative infinity and positive infinity. If 0 is generated, the blank is returned. In the event that the random number generated is positive, the string to be returned is the constant "b" with the "+" symbol as well as the unknown variable, x

- Generate a random number for the constant "c" using the approach used to generate a random number for the constant "b".  In the event that the random number generated is positive, the string to be returned is the constant "c" with the "+" symbol but without the unknown variable x

- Generate a quadratic equation in the standard from ax^2 + bx + c = 0 using the random numbers generated for each of the constants. 

- Print 10 quadratic equations using random numbers generated for each of the constants using the procedure noted above


Assignment 2.2.
- Import the random library which provides access to the function which enables the generation of random numbers
- Import the math library which provides access to mathematical functions

- A quadratic equation has real roots if the discriminant is equals to or greater than 0. For a quadratic equation of the standard form ax^2 + bx + c = 0, with constants a,b and c, the discriminant is determined as b * b - 4 * a * c.

- Generate random numbers of the constant a,b and c in the range -10 to 10 and ensuring a is not zero. Determine the value of the discriminant using the random numbers generated for constants a,b, and c. 

- Call the function again until 10 quadratic equations with real roots are returned


Assignment 2.3
- Import the random library which provides access to the function which enables the generation of random numbers
- Import the math library which provides access to mathematical functions
- Generate random numbers of the constant a,b and c in the range -10 to 10 and ensuring a is not zero
- Determine the value of the discriminant using the random numbers generated for constants a,b, and c. 
- If the discriminant of the quadratic equation is zero, the quadratic equation has one real root. The root is determined using the standard quadratic formula
-  If the discriminant of the quadratic equation is greater than zero, the quadratic equation has two real roots. The roots are determined using the standard quadratic formula. The first root is determined by adding the discriminant to "-b", where "b" is a randomly generated constant and dividing the result by 2 times the randomly generated constant "a". The second root is  determined by subtracting the discriminant from "-b", where "b" is a randomly generated constant and dividing the result by 2 times the randomly generated constant "a".
- As a property of quadratic equations is that the constant "a" cannot be zero, should the generated number constant "a" be zero, return a note stating that the equation is not a quadratic function
